    "_Assuming a made-up scenario in which we have been employed by a large real estate company who wants to invest in good value homes for sale to High Networth Individuals. For the purpose of this scenario, all the parameters are assumed to have been researched and requested for by this ficticious company \"GP Real Estate\"_"

    "### **Objective and Background**<br>\n",
    "GP Real Estate has been in the business of constructing industrial units and warehouses for large corporates for over 25 years. As the company has grown over the years, as have their clients and client base. Some of their clients are in the computers and computer peripheral products industry which has seen a large demand even during the Covid-19 pandemic. With increasing demans and profits, these companies have been purchasing more industrial properties to increase their production. However, now these promoters (High Networth Individuals) are looking for personal investments in residential properties. During some of their informal meetings, they voiced their interest in investing in good value homes in good neighbourhoods, and that they have been on the look-out for a good real estate company which might help them with their search.\n",
    "The sales team at GP Real Estate realized that they can add a new Residential vertical and pitched this idea to the stakeholders with the backing of a few interested clients. Been given a tentative go-ahead, the company contacted us for developing a model which will help them predict the right kind of townships to establish a new housing development. This which will give them the right entry into the residential game.\n",
    "While GP Real Estate has clients across the nation, the company is headquartered in New York, and has a big chunk of clients who are based in Eastern United States, and looking for investments in the same region.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Understanding the Data**<br>\n",
    "This is a model for predicting which townships are more likely to have residential houses of higher value.\n",
    "Over the past 2 years, due to the Covid-19 pandemic the job market saw an unprecedented disruption. This also lead to change in the way we work, with many organizations offering the flexibility of 'Work from Home' to counter the spread of and also in response to the Great Resignation. Due to this, more and more individuals are relocating to better localities to achieve their dreams of investing in good homes.\n",
    "This has led to an increase in the value of real estate, especially over the past few months. However, as the demand has increased, the values of all the houses have gone up irrespective of the location and quality of the house.\n",
    "\n",
    "Due to this real estate companies and individual investors are on the look out for quality houses, and hence need relevant data in order to take well informed decisions.\n",
    "\n",
    "There is a great article which dives in deep into the reasons behind the increase in housing prices:\n",
    "https://www.nyrentownsell.com/blog/why-are-houses-so-expensive/\n",
    "\n",
    "An excerpt from the article: _Following the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, interest rates were reduced to boost economic health. The drastic drop in interest rates, combined with numerous Americans’ desire to abandon apartments and cities in favor of residential areas and lower prices, created an increased demand. In contrast, many sellers withdrew from the market due to political and economic instability. More buyers than sellers have since entered the real estate market, and total house prices have dramatically increased as a result._\n",
    "\n",
    ">Dataset Details:\n",
    "We have the records for roughly 500 “townships” or municipalities in the Eastern United States. We need to use the area characteristics provided in the data to predict whether or not the township is likely to possess a lot of high valued properties.<br>\n",
    "(Typically, townships in the USA refers to a small geographical area)\n",
    "\n",
    "Click here to know more details about townships in the USA: https://www.britannica.com/topic/township \n",
    "\n",
    "This prediction could be helpful for building companies who want to know where to establish a new housing development. Other real-estate ventures would be interested as well.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "A few things to keep in mind before proceeding with the Prediction Model:\n",
    ">**Target audience**<br>\n",
    ">Apart from GP Real Estate, there are quite a few Real-estate investors and HNIs who would benefit vastly with such a prediction model. If this model works out, our firm can use similar models to pitch to new clients who want to venture into residential housing estate in different parts of the country<br><br>\n",
    ">**Actionables**<br>\n",
    ">Users of this model shall be able to select the right townships for their investments. This will directly impact both their topline as well as bottom line, as the model will be able to help them take quick and informed decisions, suitable for their target audience.<br><br>\n",
    ">**Who are the key stakeholders?**<br>\n",
    ">This model shall be of great use to Real estate companies/ property owners, and high networth investors<br><br>\n",
    ">**Outcome of this Prediction Model**<br>\n",
    ">Using Machine Learning to accurately predict which townships are to be preferred for the objective of finding townships with high value properties. The additional application displayed with the help of streamlit is to showcase the findings in an aesthetic manner.\n"
